GitHub Actions	Automates testing, building, and deployment processes for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

# 🗃️ Database Design
Below is an overview of the key entities and their relationships in the StayBackend project:

🧑‍💼 Users
Stores information about platform users.

id: unique identifier

name: full name

email: unique email address

password: hashed password

role: host or guest

Relationship:
A user can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

🏠 Properties
Details of homes listed on the platform.

id: unique identifier

owner_id: references user (host)

title: name of the property

description: brief details

location: address or coordinates

Relationship:
A property belongs to a user (host) and can have many bookings and reviews.

📅 Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users.

id: unique identifier

property_id: references the booked property

user_id: references the guest

check_in: booking start date

check_out: booking end date

Relationship:
Each booking is made by one user for one property.

✍️ Reviews
Captures user feedback.

id: unique identifier

user_id: reviewer

property_id: reviewed property

rating: numeric rating

comment: optional text feedback

Relationship:
A user can review many properties; a property can have many reviews.

💳 Payments
Manages transactions for bookings.

id: unique identifier

booking_id: references the related booking

amount: amount paid

status: success, failed, pending

payment_date: timestamp of transaction

Relationship:
Each payment is tied to one booking.

# 🧩 Feature Breakdown
👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It handles authentication, role-based access (host or guest), and password protection to ensure data privacy.

# 🏘️ Property Management
Hosts can list, update, and delete properties with relevant details like title, location, and description. This feature enables users to showcase their accommodations to potential guests.

# 📅 Booking System
Guests can book available properties for specific dates. This module ensures date availability, prevents double-bookings, and allows both users and hosts to track booking history.

# 💳 Payment Integration
Securely handles payment processing for bookings. It tracks transactions, manages payment statuses, and ensures a smooth financial flow between guests and hosts.

# ✍️ Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave feedback and rate properties after their stay. This feature helps maintain trust and transparency in the platform by giving future guests insight into past experiences.


# 🔐 API Security
Securing the backend is essential to protect sensitive user information, payment data, and the integrity of the platform. The following measures are implemented:

# ✅ Authentication
Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and private data.

# 🔒 Authorization
Role-based access control restricts what different users (e.g., host vs guest) can do. It ensures that users only perform actions allowed by their role — like only hosts managing listings.

# 🚫 Rate Limiting
Limits the number of API requests per user over a time period to prevent abuse or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. It helps maintain server performance and security.

# 🔐 Data Encryption
All sensitive data, especially passwords and payment information, is encrypted at rest and in transit. This protects against data breaches and information leaks.

# 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS). This maintains the reliability and integrity of the database.
